# First Python session: A friendly introduction to Python
## Requirements
### üêç Python
To get the most out of this class, you should have python version 3+ installed.
You can follow most of this tutorial using [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3),
but I recommend getting Python locally for the 2nd half of this friendly introduction.

### Other requirements
You'll need a laptop to get the most out of the class.
If you don't have one, get ahold of me directly and I'll help find you one and get Linux running on it.
And you'll need to install a code editor, I recommend [Atom](atom.io).
Hopefully little to no previous experience required!
(But feel free to tell me otherwise!)

## Tutorial agenda
This is generally a two hour class, not including getting Python installed on folk's computers.
In the first hour we cover how to use the command line on your computer to:
- Check what version of Python is installed
- Run Python interactively
- Navigate directories (in Windows, OSX, or Linux)
- Run Python files

We're going cover the material in [tutorial.md](00_friendly_introduction/tutorial.md).
The tutorial is adapted from the Boston Python Workshop for Women, and updated to Python 3.

In the second hour we will cover writing a Python script in a file.
Here we introduce writing our own functions, and practice everything we learned.


### IRL: In Real Life
If you're following along with this tutorial with me,
I may diverge from this script, particularly in the second half.
